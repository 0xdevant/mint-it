# FAQs & How-tos

What is MintIt?
MintIt is one of the world's simplest NFT marketplace where you can discover, collect, mint, and sell extraordinary NFTs.

How should I get started?
If you are a creator, start off by going to Create and list your valuable NFTs and earn ETH from selling them!

There are two token standards that you could choose from, the ERC-721 and the ERC-1155, in short, ERC-721 represents a single edition of a NFT, while ERC-1155 represents multiple editions of a NFT which means it can have more than one copy, technical-wise below are the differences they have:

ERC-1155 permits the creation of both semi-fungible tokens and non-fungible tokens, whereas ERC-721 permits only the latter.
In ERC-1155, smart contracts are linked to multiple URIs and do not store additional metadata (such as file names). In comparison, ERC-721 only supports static metadata stored directly on the smart contract for each token ID,, increasing deployment costs and limiting flexibility.
ERC-1155â€™s smart contracts support an infinite number of tokens, whereas ERC-721 needs a new smart contract for each type of token.
ERC-1155 also allows batch transfers of tokens, which can reduce transaction costs and times. With ERC-721, if you want to send multiple tokens, they happen individually.
With that being said, the ERC-721 token standard kicked off the NFT craze. It was the first of its kind, and consequently, the most popular standard for creating these unique tokens.

If you are a collector, feel free to explore any NFTs you feel interested in homepage and add them to your collections by purchasing them!
