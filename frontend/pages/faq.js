                      There are two token standards that you could choose from,
                      the <b>ERC-721</b> and the <b>ERC-1155</b>, in short,
                      ERC-721 represents a single edition of a NFT, while
                      ERC-1155 represents multiple editions of a NFT which means
                      it can have more than one copy, technical-wise below are
                      the differences they have:
                    </p>
                    <ul className="list-disc px-8">
                      <li>
                        ERC-1155 permits the creation of both semi-fungible
                        tokens and non-fungible tokens, whereas ERC-721 permits
                        only the latter.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        In ERC-1155, smart contracts are linked to multiple URIs
                        and do not store additional metadata (such as file
                        names). In comparison, ERC-721 only supports static
                        metadata stored directly on the smart contract for each
                        token ID,, increasing deployment costs and limiting
                        flexibility.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        ERC-1155â€™s smart contracts support an infinite number of
                        tokens, whereas ERC-721 needs a new smart contract for
                        each type of token.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        ERC-1155 also allows batch transfers of tokens, which
                        can reduce transaction costs and times. With ERC-721, if
                        you want to send multiple tokens, they happen
                        individually.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      With that being said, the ERC-721 token standard kicked
                      off the NFT craze. It was the first of its kind, and
                      consequently, the most popular standard for creating these
                      unique tokens.{" "}

              Gas fees are transaction fees on Ethereum. MintIt does not receive
              these fees and is not able to refund them.
